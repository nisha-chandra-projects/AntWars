# AntWars
This project simulates a game in which a 2D grid is populated with ants and beetles (based on a file being read).  The game plays against itself.

The game is a simple, casual game where players try to avoid their ant colony being destroyed by an invading colony of 
beetles. The player will have an opportunity to play against an AI or against another player.  A more detailed description of the game's design and implementation can be found in the attached file.
